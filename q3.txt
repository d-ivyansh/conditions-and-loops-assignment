Loops are essential programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. They are used when you need to perform a task multiple times or iterate over a collection of data.

There are mainly three types of loops in programming: the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. 


For Loop: Used for iterating over a block of code a fixed number of times.

**
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code block to be executed
}
**

While Loop: Executes a block of code while a specified condition is true.
**
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
**



Do-While Loop: Similar to a while loop, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is checked.

**
let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
