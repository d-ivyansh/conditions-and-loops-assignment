Conditional statements are fundamental constructs in programming that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. These statements provide the ability to create branching logic in your code, enabling it to make decisions and respond accordingly.

If Statement: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
**//
if (condition) {
    // code block to be executed if condition is true
}
//**


If-Else Statement: It executes one block of code if a specified condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.
**//
if (condition) {
    // code block to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code block to be executed if condition is false
}
//**


If-Else-If Statement (or Else If): It allows you to specify multiple conditions to be checked sequentially. It executes the block of code corresponding to the first true condition encountered.
**//
if (condition1) {
    // code block to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code block to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code block to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}
//**
